## About

The ‘Importance of Play’ app supports early childhood educators and parents to understand why play is critical to all children’s development.

In a political climate where academic instruction is being pushed into early childhood education and where ‘drill and skill’ approaches are hot topics, it is critical that early years practitioners have tools and resources to promote play-based education.
This app includes presentations, a podcast and materials to support promotion of the importance of play.

## Programming

This application was developed for iOS9 using Xcode and Objective-C by Aidan Cornelius-Bell.
